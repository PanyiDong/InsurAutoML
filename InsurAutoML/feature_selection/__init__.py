Note: Aug. 8, 2022
The feature selection methods are arranged more systematically, which uses the categories defined
by Chandrashekar (2014):
1. Filter: use some statistical measures to score and select features.
2. Wrapper: use a machine learning model to score and select features.
3. Embedded: embed feature importance in the model training to select features.
4. Hybrid: combine the filter and wrapper method.

Other methods are imported and only called here.
